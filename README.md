# Password-Door-Locking-System-Circuit
A door lock project based on a Arduino board

I’ll use for the lock a solenoid and a relay, it depends on your lock system you’ll have to chose a wiring, codes and adapt them.

 **N.B: For a real project, I don’t recommend using a solenoid at all, but rather hack a lock that can be opened by both electronic and mechanic lock and adapt your project for it.**

**PARTS**
So for this project we will need those components, alongside some jump wires, and a power supply of 12V Sorry I didn’t add it here:
